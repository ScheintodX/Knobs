=== JUST NOT READY, YET! ===
(but let's call it *beta*)

Library for easy plug&play use of buttons and switches (and more to come)

"It seems that perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add,
but when there is nothing more to take away."
                                                    (Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry)

TLDR: Just look in the examples folder.

The purpose of this project is to provide an extremely simple to use but
nevertheless powerfull library which simplifies the building of hardware
user-interfaces.


ISSUES:
 * Not ready yet
 * Make even more simple to use
